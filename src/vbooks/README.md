# vtasks.vbooks subflow

The `vtasks.vbooks` subflow is responsible for extracting data from a Google spreadsheet that contains two sections: a list of all the books I have read and a reading list of books I plan to read.

Using this extracted data, the subflow generates a report that showcases the information in a visually appealing format. An example of the report is shown below:

The report provides an overview of the books I have read, including details such as the book title, author, and date completed. It also highlights the books in my reading list, indicating the ones I plan to read in the future.

By extracting data from the Google spreadsheet and creating a comprehensive report, the `vtasks.vbooks` subflow allows me to keep track of my reading habits and organize my reading list effectively.
