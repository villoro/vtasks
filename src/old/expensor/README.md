# vtasks.expensor subflow

The `vtasks.expensor` subflow takes the data extracted from the [cryptos](../cryptos/README.md), [money_lover](../money_lover/README.md) and [indexa](../indexa/README.md) subflows. It also incorporates historical data from a spreadsheet that tracks my finances.

Using this combined dataset, the `vtasks.expensor` subflow generates static `html` reports that showcase relevant information about my personal finances. These reports provide insights into various aspects of my financial activities.

Here are some example pages from the generated reports:

It's important to note that the reports are designed to be responsive, ensuring optimal viewing experience across different devices and screen sizes. Here's an example of the report displayed on a Nexus 5X device:
